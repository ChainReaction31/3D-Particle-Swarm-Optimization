# Particle Swarm Visualization

Simple Example of Particle Swarm Optimization with a single target point.

Currently, there is no user interaction other than camera movement when running the game so if you want to change the target point or number of particles, that should be done via the Unity Editor.

## UI TODO
1. Start, Stop, Pause Simulation
2. Change Target Point
3. Iteration information (Current number of steps, Global Best Position, etc.)
4. Change FixedUpdate for faster/slower iteration

## Simulation TODO
1. Boundary Logic link to Dimensions
